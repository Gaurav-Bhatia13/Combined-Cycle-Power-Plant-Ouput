# Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant-Ouput
It is a ML regression project where I used ANN to predict output
Dataset- Combined Cycle Power Plant (Source- UCI Machine Learning Respiratory) 
Libraries used-(Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow)
Input layer consists of 4 units of neurons/independent features which are Temperature, Pressure, Vapour Density, Humidity.
2 Hidden layers were added having 6 units of neuron each.
Optimizer used- Adam
Loss= 'mean_squared_error'
Epochs =100
Finally, error converged to 26.9 ,(after 50 epochs).
Precision was set upto 2 Decimals.
Output of Produced Electricity Units was Analysed.
